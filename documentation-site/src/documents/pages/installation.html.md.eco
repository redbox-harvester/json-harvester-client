Although technically possible, this core or base project in itself is not meant to be installed in a production setting.

Please return to the [main Harvester documentation][parentDoc] and select a more specific implementation.

However, if you want to play around with the base implementation, the base implementation can be executed using the packaged sample configuration. 
Amongst others, the base implementation has sample configuration to send JSON files to [ReDBox][redboxUrl] as a ReDBox dataset. 

To play around with the sample configuration, do the following:

1. Download the base harvester client. The latest development snapshot version can be [downloaded here][hcSnapLatest]
2. Expand the zip file.
3. Create a "input" directory within the expanded directory.
4. Download a [sample JSON file from here][sampleDatasetJson], placing it inside the "input" directory.
5. Run the latest ReDBox software. For instructions on how to install ReDBox, [go here][redboxUrl]
6. Go to the expanded directory and execute the "harvest_file.bat" or "harvest_file.sh" depending on your OS.

You should then see a ReDBox dataset with workflow status of "Metadata Review".
