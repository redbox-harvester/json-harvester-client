A typical Harvester Client is configured through 2 files: a Spring Integration definition file (XML) and a configuration file written in Groovy's flexible, environment-aware [ConfigSlurper][ConfigSlurper] format. The latter configuration is loaded by the system through the [Config][ConfigUtilSrc] utility class. That class requires specific entries to be present before it can be successfully loaded. For details, please see its <a href="<%= @utility.url %>pages/config" class="rewritable-url">documentation</a>.

The ConfigSlurper format config file entries may vary, depending on <a href="installation" class="rewritable-url">how the Harvester Client is installed</a>. 

## Spring Integration Configuration
The XML file configures the Spring Integration channel definitions. This is the main configuration file of the Harvester Client. [Here's a sample.][SampleXMLConfig]

## Environment-specific and miscellaneous configuration
Entries in this file supplement the Spring Integration configuration, as well as provide configuration values to other external applications, such as the Harvester Manager. [Here's a sample.][SampleConfig]

This page will intentionally omit the description of the individual entries of this file, since often these are specific to the implementation. However, to provide a gentle introduction, the section below will describe the sample configuration referred to in this document.

## Sample Configuration: JSON File --> ReDBox Dataset
The sample configuration has to be installed as a console application and will do the following:
1. Monitor a specific input directory for .json files
2. Send the file contents verbatim to ReDBox
3. Move the file to the input directory

This page will not describe the Spring Integration configuration elements, [please see its documentation][SI-Main].

### Sample Configuration
The elements below are critical entries in the configuration.
<table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
  <tr>
    <th>Configuration Entry</th>
    <th>Purpose</th>
    <th>Remarks</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  	<td>client.siPath</td>
  	<td>
  		The path to the Spring Integration configuration file.
  	</td>
  	<td>
  		The uniqueness applies to the context of the integration environment. The uniqueness is not tested and must be verified externally as part of the integration work.
  	</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  	<td>harvest.directory</td>
  	<td>
  		The directory that will be monitored for JSON files
  	</td>
  	<td>
  		The path can be relative to the installation directory.
  	</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  	<td>harvest.output.json.directory</td>
  	<td>
  		The directory where JSON files are moved post-processing.
  	</td>
  	<td>
  		The path can be relative to the installation directory.

  <tr>
  	<td>activemq.url</td>
  	<td>
  		The ActiveMQ url where the data will be sent.
